HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-<c>null</c> error object will only be part of an API response when calling <c>/item/get</c> to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be <c>null</c> if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.</para>
